   abstract = {<p>The technological growth of the last decades has brought many improvements in daily life, but also concerns on how to deal with electronic waste. Electrical and electronic equipment waste is the fastest-growing rate in the industrialized world. One of the elements of electronic equipment is the printed circuit board (PCB) and almost every electronic equipment has a PCB inside it. While waste PCB (WPCB) recycling may result in the recovery of potentially precious materials and the reuse of some components, it is a challenging task because its composition diversity requires a cautious pre-processing stage to achieve optimal recycling outcomes. Our research focused on proposing a method to evaluate the economic feasibility of recycling integrated circuits (ICs) from WPCB. The proposed method can help decide whether to dismantle a separate WPCB before the physical or mechanical recycling process and consists of estimating the IC area from a WPCB, calculating the IC’s weight using surface density, and estimating how much metal can be recovered by recycling those ICs. To estimate the IC area in a WPCB, we used a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning model (YOLO) and the PCB DSLR image dataset to detect the WPCB’s ICs. Regarding IC detection, the best result was obtained with the partitioned analysis of each image through a sliding window, thus creating new images of smaller dimensions, reaching 86.77% mAP. As a final result, we estimate that the Deep PCB Dataset has a total of 1079.18 g of ICs, from which it would be possible to recover at least 909.94 g of metals and silicon elements from all WPCBs’ ICs. Since there is a high variability in the compositions of WPCBs, it is possible to calculate the gross income for each WPCB and use it as a decision criterion for the type of pre-processing.</p>},

   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic, a disease transmitted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has already caused the infection of more than 120 million people, of which 70 million have been recovered, while 3 million people have died. The high speed of infection has led to the rapid depletion of public health resources in most countries. RT-PCR is Covid-19’s reference diagnostic method. In this work we propose a new technique for representing DNA sequences: they are divided into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach and represented by co-occurrence matrices. This technique eliminates multiple sequence alignment. Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a large database: 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARS-CoV-2. When comparing SARS-CoV-2 with virus families with similar symptoms, we obtained 0.97 ± 0.03 for sensitivity and 0.9919 ± 0.0005 for specificity with MLP classifier and 30% overlap. When SARS-CoV-2 is compared to other coronaviruses and healthy human DNA sequences, we obtained 0.99 ± 0.01 for sensitivity and 0.9986 ± 0.0002 for specificity with MLP and 50% overlap. Therefore, the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19 can be optimized by combining RT-PCR and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify DNA sequences for SARS-CoV-2 with greater specificity and sensitivity.},

   abstract = {<p>Computer vision techniques can monitor the rotational speed of rotating equipment or machines to understand their working conditions and prevent failures. Such techniques are highly precise, contactless, and potentially suitable for applications without massive setup changes. However, traditional vision sensors collect a significant amount of data to process and measure the rotation of high-speed systems, and they are susceptible to motion blur. This work proposes a new method for measuring rotational speed processing event-based data applied to high-speed systems using a neuromorphic sensor. This sensor produces event-based data and is designed to work with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. The main advantages of the Event-based Angular Speed Measurement (EB-ASM) method are the high dynamic range, the absence of motion blurring, and the possibility of measuring multiple rotations simultaneously with a single device. The proposed method uses the time difference between spikes in a Kernel or Window selected in the sensor frame range. It is evaluated in two experimental scenarios by measuring a fan rotational speed and a Router Computer Numerical Control (CNC) spindle. The results compare measurements with a calibrated digital photo-tachometer. Based on the performed tests, the EB-ASM can measure the rotational speed with a mean absolute error of less than 0.2% for both scenarios.</p>},

The paper evaluates supervised contrastive learning that encourages similar instances to have closer representations in the feature space while pushing different instances apart. The results indicate that supervised contrastive learning does not significantly improve accuracy with abundant data but outperforms the standard CNN approach in few-shot scenarios, achieving an accuracy of 81% compared to 33% in the traditional approach.

Understanding the complex relationship between land transformations and temperature changes is crucial for effective decision-making in the face of climate change. This study uses a data-driven approach to assess the effect of urban expansion and deforestation on temperature rise in Cajazeiras, Brazil. By integrating statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, we investigate the influence of urban areas and other factors on temperature trends. The statistical model (ARIMA) reveals a strong association between urbanization and temperature increase, emphasizing the need to address urban development and land use changes to mitigate rising temperatures. The SHAP values technique applied to a Random Forest model also uncovers additional drivers of temperature rise beyond urban expansion, such as the absence of savanna formation near the city. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in mitigating the impact of climate change.},

To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology that combines CNNs and Shapley values to develop an interpretable diagnosis system for Sigatoka disease in banana leaves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with the SHAP VGG 16 model outperforming other models in accurately identifying the affected surface beside the disease classification. Furthermore, this CNN model, particularly with good image focus and framing, show promise in detecting and evaluating the disease.

   abstract = {The increasing waste of electronic equipment causes adverse environmental impacts and emphasizes the importance of component reuse for a sustainable circular economy. This study uses few-shot learning to explore variations of machine learning models, specifically deep learning, to detect toroidal inductors on circuit boards. A customized database with 50 labeled images of toroidal inductors was developed and made available online due to the limitation of available data. Three detection models were trained and evaluated using different amounts of training images (10, 20, and 30 images) and proportional epochs. The results show that models trained with 20 and 30 images achieved satisfactory performance, with an accuracy of 96.8% and 97.1%, and mAP50 of 98.2% and 99%, respectively. However, the model trained with only ten training images showed inferior results, with an accuracy of 6.2% and recall of 28.6%. The results indicate that using 20 to 30 images in training can be an efficient strategy for detecting components on circuit boards and that the number of training images correlates differently with the model’s performance. Additionally, image quality, proper hyperparameter selection, and choice of detection algorithm are crucial factors in obtaining reliable results in different detection tasks. This study contributes to developing more sustainable and responsible solutions for the reuse of electronic components while emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors when training detection models to ensure efficient and reliable results.},

   abstract = {Electronic components (EC) detection is relevant for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing, quality inspection, and assurance (cyber-security). Moreover, at end-of-life electronic devices, the PCBs become Waste PCBs (WPCBs), the primary source of high-value materials in electronic waste. However, the recycling process is challenging because of the WPCB's high composition diversity. EC detection in WPCBs can reduce the uncertainty about WPCBs composition and help select a better recycling process. Nevertheless, large fully-annotated datasets for the PCB domain are available at a high cost. For WPCBs, there is only one publicly available dataset, the PCB-DSLR, and it is partially labeled. As for PCBs, the FICS-PCB dataset is available. However, it contains images of modern and clean PCBs, all in good condition, while the first has broken and dirty parts. Thus, we propose a self-training strategy for object detection algorithms without needing a fully labeled dataset. In the strategy, the YOLOv5 model is used to detect the eight types of electronic components present in FICS-PCB in PCB-DSLR, which initially has labels only for integrated circuits. The process occurs through the interaction between a teacher model, trained with the FICSPCB data, and a student model, which is trained by joining the FICS-PCB data and the teacher-generated labels for PCB-DSLR. The results show that the student model performs better in the electronic components detection task, obtaining greater precision and sensitivity when compared to the teacher model. Since we are dealing with partially labeled data, we provide a low-dimensional representation of the detections of both models using t-SNE.},

Different techniques have been explored to achieve reliable results in real-world conditions; however, the most suitable configuration of methods remains to be an open problem. This study proposes a model consisting of four stages: preprocessing, extractive summarization using page rank algorithm, feature extraction with bag-of-words, and classification with Support Vector Classifier. Testing sessions were conducted using three versions of the model as a mean for comparison and evaluation. The first one was a basic classifier without preprocessing nor summarization stages, the second included preprocessing but not summarization, and the third one was an implementation of the complete proposed model. All three were evaluated using a separated set of examples falling into six different labeled categories and their performance was recorded calculating weighted average precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy values. The best performance obtained was the one presented by the proposed model with precision, recall and F-1 score values of 96% each, which represents a 2% improvement for all of them in comparison to the first version and a 1 % improvement for precision and recall in comparison to the second version. Specially F1-score pointing to the most balanced performance, the proposed model outperformed the versions of it itself excluding some stages, allowing to infer that preprocessing and extractive summarization have positive impacts in the text classification task for Portuguese-written legal documents.},
